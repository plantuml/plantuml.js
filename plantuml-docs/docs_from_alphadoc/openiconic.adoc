== OpenIconic

https://useiconic.com/open/[OpenIconic] is an very nice open source icon set.
Those icons have been integrated into the link::creole[creole parser], so you can use them out-of-the-box.

You can use the following syntax: `+<&ICON_NAME>+`.

<plantuml>
@startuml
title: <size:20><&heart>Use of OpenIconic<&heart></size>
class Wifi
note left
  Click on <&wifi>
end note
@enduml
</plantuml>


It also works with link::salt[salt, the graphical interface designer].
<plantuml>
@startsalt
{
  Login<&person> | "MyName   "
  Password<&key> | "****     "
  [Cancel <&circle-x>] | [OK <&account-login>]
}
@endsalt
</plantuml>

The complete list is available on https://useiconic.com/open/[OpenIconic Website], or
you can use the following special diagram:
